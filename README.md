## WooCommerce - Show Lowest Price Only in Variable Products
Show only the lowest prices in WooCommerce variable products, and lowest sale price, instead the messy full range of prices and sales.

By default, WooCommerce shows full price range when it comes to variable products and there is no option in the **Settings** page to change that behavior or hide the Highest Price and display Only the Lowest Price.

With this plugin, you can hide the Highest Price in variable products and just Show the Lowest Price to encourage more sales.

**This plugin has No options or settings**, just activate the plugin and it’s done.

<strong>Optional</strong>: You can hide the "From:" text by adding this CSS snippet to the 'Additional CSS' section of the WordPress Customizer or in your child theme's CSS file:
<pre>span.woogenie-from-label { display: none; }</pre>
